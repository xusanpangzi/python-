My dream
모모hello everyone!
모모Students밃 guests 밃 teachers and Honorable Judges
모모Good morning !
모모my great pleasure to share my dream with you today몪 my dream is to bee a teacher몪몪몪몪
모모As the whole world has its boundaries밃 limits and freedom coexist in our life몪 I don몶t expect plete freedom밃 which is impossible몪 I simply have a dream that supports my life몪
모모I dream that one day밃 I could escape from the deep sea of thick schoolbooks and lead my own life몪 With my favorite fictions밃 I lie freely on the green grass밃 smelling the spring밃 listening to the wind singing밃 breathing the fresh and cool air and dissolve my soul in nature at last몪 Simple and short enjoyment can bring me great satisfaction몪
모모I dream that one day the adults could throw their prejudice of ic and cartoon away몪 They could keep a lovely heart that can share sorrow and happiness with us while watching cartoon or doing personal things몪 That몶s the real munication of heart to heart몪
모모I have the belief that my dreams should e true몪 I am looking forward to some day ing when I am like a proud eagle밃 which flies to the blue and vast sky몪
모모Thank you!
