Hold Fast To Your Dreams
°°°°I have a dream today°£
°°°°I have a dream that one day every vally shall be exalted£¨ every hill and mountain shall be made low£¨ the rough places will be made plain£¨ and the crooked places will be made straight£¨ and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed£¨ and all flesh shall see it together°£
°°°°Wow£¨ what a dream it has been for Martin Luther King°£ But the changing world seems telling me that people gradually get their dreams lost somehow in the process of growing up£¨ and sometimes I personally find myself saying goodbye unconsciously to those distant childhood dreams°£
°°°°However£¨ we meed dreams°£ They nourish our spirit; they represent possibility even when we are dragged down by reality°£ They keep us going°£ Most successful people are dreamers as well as ordinary people who are not afraid to think big and dare to be great°£ When we were little kids£¨ we all dreamed of doing something big and splashy£¨ something significant°£ Now what we need to do is to maintain them£¨ refresh them and turn them into reality°£ However£¨ the toughest part is that we often have no ideas how to translate these dreams into actions°£ Well£¨ just start with concrete objectives and stick to it°£ Don°Øt let the nameless fear confuse the eye and confound our strong belief of future°£ Through our talents£¨ through our wits£¨ through our endurance and through our creativity£¨ we will make it°£[”…www.duanmeiwen.com’˚¿Ì]
°°°°Hold fast to dreams£¨ for if dreams die£¨ life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly°£ Hold fast to dreams£¨ for when dreams go£¨ life is a barren field frozen with snow°£ So my dear friends£¨ think of your old and maybe dead dreams°£ Whatever it is£¨ pick it up and make it alive from today°£
