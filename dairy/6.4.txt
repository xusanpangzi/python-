I have a dream today
모모hello everyone!
모모I have a dream that one day every vally shall be exalted밃 every hill and mountain shall be made low밃 the rough places will be made plain밃 and the crooked places will be made straight밃 and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed밃 and all flesh shall see it together몪
모모Wow밃 what a dream it has been for Martin Luther King몪 But the changing world seems telling me that people gradually get their dreams lost somehow in the process of growing up밃 and sometimes I personally find myself saying goodbye unconsciously to those distant childhood dreams몪
모모However밃 we meed dreams몪 They nourish our spirit; they represent possibility even when we are dragged down by reality몪 They keep us going몪 Most successful people are dreamers as well as ordinary people who are not afraid to think big and dare to be great몪 When we were little kids밃 we all dreamed of doing something big and splashy밃 something significant몪 Now what we need to do is to maintain them밃 refresh them and turn them into reality몪 However밃 the toughest part is that we often have no ideas how to translate these dreams into actions몪 Well밃 just start with concrete objectives and stick to it몪 Don몶t let the nameless fear confuse the eye and confound our strong belief of future몪 Through our talents밃 through our wits밃 through our endurance and through our creativity밃 we will make it몪
모모Hold fast to dreams밃 for if dreams die밃 life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly몪 Hold fast to dreams밃 for when dreams go밃 life is a barren field frozen with snow몪 So my dear friends밃 think of your old and maybe dead dreams몪 Whatever it is밃 pick it up and make it alive from today몪
모모Thank you!
